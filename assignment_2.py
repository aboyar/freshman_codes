'''
Write a python program with appropriate comments that creates customersâ€™ bills for a carpet company when given the following information:
The length and the width of the carpet in feet
The carpet price per square foot
The per cent discount for each customer
The labor cost is fixed at $0.35 per square foot and is to be defined as a constant. 
The tax rate is 8.5% applied after the discount. It is also to be defined as a constant.
The input data consist of a set of three integers representing the length and width of the room to be carpeted, the percentage of the discount the owner gives to a customer, and a real number representing the unit price of the carpet. The program is to prompt the user for this input as shown below.
